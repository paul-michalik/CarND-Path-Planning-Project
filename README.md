# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program


## Model description

The model is based on the suggestions from the Q&A session. A discrete decision engine makes decisions based on current state and informations from the telemetry and sensors. The implementation in `planner.h` consists of a `pp::planner` which provides a method `get_next_vals` to retrieve a new path based on following information:
- Next chunk of telemetry data
- Time difference between a previous and current invocation
- The internal state of the planner

The planner proceeds in five distinct steps:

1. Localize the car with respect to given map
2. Determine road environment model
3. Decide which target lane and target speed are optimal 
4. Make sure that the calculated targets do not violate the speed limit and that they do not cause collision with other cars
5. Calculate a resulting trajectory based on given targets   

### Localization

The implementation is in `localization.h` and the actual localization is performed in function `pp::localize`. Given the telemetry data and the environment map the function calculates the `localization_info` which consists of ego position and motion of the car and the information about the current lane.   
### Road environment model

The implementation is in `road.h` and the model is calculated in the function `pp::make_lane_model`. The model is represented by an array of ``lane_info` objects which contain following information for each lane of the road:

- the closest car in front of the ego position, its speed and the gap towards the ego position in Frenet frame coordinates
- the closest car in the back of the current ego position, its speed and the gap towards the ego position in Frenet frame coordinates 

### The decision engine

The planner maintains information about an internal state. The possible internal states and transitions among them are defined by a discrete `pp::decision_engine` which calculates the next target values based on current target and localization information provided by the localization module. The `pp::decision_engine` is implemented in `decision_engine.h` 

The internal states are:
- `changing_lane`
- `keeping_lane`
- `prepare_changing_lane`

The engine determines the currently best lane `pp::decision_engine::get_best_lane` and sets it as a next target. It evaluates a set of rules based on simple physics and logic and decides if a switch from current to the target lane is feasible. The best lane is defined as a lane with maximum velocity which in turn is defined by the current lane situation as represented by the environment model.   

### Adjustment of speed and collision avoidance

The methods `pp::planner::avoid_collison` and `pp::planner::adjust_speed` constrain the target speed based on the safety margins for maximum speed and a minimum gap between the ego vehicle and the vehicle in front of ot in the current lane.    

### The trajectory calculation

The resulting trajectory is calculated based on proposals from Q&A session. It uses the information about the current and next predicted locations to determine a discrete sequence of trajectory anchors which in turn are interpolated by a cubic spline curve. This is implemented in the methods `pp::planner::make_anchors` and `pp::planner::make_trajectory`.

### Reflection

This was by far the most challenging project in the CarND program. I had a very hard time to come up with a proper interpretation of the data delivered by the simulator and the logic which the simulator uses to actually move the car. The testing of the behavior was very difficult due to the indeterministic environment and lack of testable models - I spent much more time on this project than initially planned.  

## Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
